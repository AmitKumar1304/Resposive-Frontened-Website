                facilitates quality learning all through the life among people of any age group, cast, creed, religion
                and region. It is the
                process of achieving knowledge, values, skills, beliefs, and moral habits. People need to get high level
                awareness about the importance of knowledge more than before. Education is very necessary for each and
                everyone in order to improve knowledge, way of living as well as social and economic status throughout
                the life. Getting proper education is the birth rights of everyone restricting which is the crime.
                Education is the ultimate way to get victory over all the personal and social problems.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">To be successful in the workplace of the future, people will need to
                have the right digital education. Whether in school, at university or on the job – the digital
                transformation that is under way is making IT skills more important every day. Digital media are also
                creating new opportunities for digital learning. I am confident that our company will be able to meet
                the challenges of digitalization and take advantage of the opportunities it presents, but we will need a
                comprehensive approach.Students using digital learning tools and technology become more engaged in the
                process and more interested in growing their knowledge base, they may not even realize that they’re
                actively learning since they’re learning through engaging methods such as peer education, teamwork,
                problem-solving, reverse teaching, concept maps, gamification, staging, role playing, and storytelling.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Educational opportunities are those opportunities that aim to enable
                individuals to acquire knowledge and certain skills, and to cultivate certain capacities. As noted
                above, we may value educational opportunity in some instances for the intrinsic value of acquiring
                knowledge, while in other cases we may care more about its instrumental effects on individual welfare
                (e.g., labor market success). Whatever our rationale for caring about educational opportunity, in order
                for an individual to be said to have this opportunity, she must have no insurmountable, irrelevant
                obstacles to the particular educational goal we have in mind. There are, however, challenges to
                overcome. Some students without reliable internet access and/or technology struggle to participate in
                digital learning; this gap is seen across countries and between income brackets within countries. Online
                learning has shown significant growth over the last decade, as the internet and education combine to
                provide people with the opportunity to gain new skills. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, online learning has
                become more centric in people's lives. The pandemic has forced schools, universities, and companies to
                remote working and this booms the usage of online learning.</p>
